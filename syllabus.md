# The specific objectives of the course are to help the students: 

1. Understand the architecture and applications of current and next generation wireless 
networks: Cellular, WLANs, sensor networks, mobile ad-hoc networks and intermittently 
connected mobile networks. 

2. Get a basic introduction to the key concepts and techniques underlying modern 
physical layer wireless and mobile communications: radio propagation modeling;performance of 
digital modulation schemes and coding techniques in fading environments; CDMA and OFDM; 
diversity and MIMO. (These topics are all explored in much greater detail in EE535, the goal 
here is to provide a sufficient survey of this topics so that the higher layer protocols are well-grounded and motivated.) 

3. Learn how to design and analyze various medium access and resource allocation 
techniques such as power control for fixed-rate and rate-adaptive systems, Al
oha and CSMA-
based randomized medium access, scheduling for TDMA/FDMA/CDMA-based wireless networks.  

4.  Learn how to design and analyze network layer routing protocols, along with key 
component mechanisms, such as link metric estimation and neighborhood table management for
proactive and reactive routing protocols, opportunistic routing, backpressure routing,network 
coding, cooperative routing, routing with mobility and intermittent contacts. 

5. Learn to design and analyze transport layer protocols, with an emphasis on congestion 
control, including TCP over wireless, congestion sharing mechanisms, explicit and precise rate 
control, utility optimization-based approaches, and backpressure-based utility
optimization. 

6. Learn how to evaluate MAC and network protocols using network simulation software 
tools such as NS-2 or Qualnet.

# Grading: 
Grading  will  be  based  on  the  weighted  average  of  scores  on  assignments,  simulation  projects, 
quizzes, and exams with the distribution as follows.

Assignments: there will be five assignments. These will together count for 25% of the grade.  

Projects:  There  will  also  be  3  simulation  projects.  These  will  together  count  for  15%  of  the 
grade. These projects are to be worked on and submitted by pairs of students working together. 

Midterm Exam: this exam will count for 30% of the grade. 

Final Exam: this exam will count for 30% of the grade.  
Grades will be based on absolute scores, not the relative distribution of scores (i.e., there will be no “curve”). A raw score of 90 or above is guaranteed an A. A raw score of 80 or above is 
guaranteed at least a B. A raw score of 70 or above is guaranteed at least a
C.
